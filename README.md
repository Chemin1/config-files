# config-files

Elektra (https://www.libelektra.org, https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/) serves as a universal and secure framework to access configuration parameters in a global, hierarchical key database. 

Its new three way merge should be able to work not only with default configurations but also with changes to configuration files done by users. Additional comments are one example for this.

You can help us build a reliable merge tool by submitting your configuration files to this repository or by sending an email to e1634025@student.tuwien.ac.at
